# Describe problem

# year = input ("which year do you want to check?")

# if year % 4 == 0:
#     if year % 100 == 0:
#         if year % 400 == 0:
#             print("Leap year")
#         else:
#             print("Not leap year")
#     else:
#         print("leap year")
# else:
#     print("Not leap year")



# Ans :-
#  In above code, year = input ("which year do you want to check?")
#    gives input in string format which needs to be converted into integer.
        # Hence change the instruction as 
        #     year = int(input("which year do you want to check?"))
